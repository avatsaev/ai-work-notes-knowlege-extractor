-  Meet: Product roadmap presentation
- Take OFF: doctolib sales team mission statement
- filler ticket:  [PIMS-1164](https://doctolib.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PIMS/boards/169?modal=detail&selectedIssue=PIMS-1164)
	- TDD: implement new tests
	- Try implement show leave dialog with `useLocation()` along with `useEffect()`
		- Problem: hook executes on first render displaying the dialog after the page loads
		- doesn't execute after leaving the page
		- no way to prevent route transition with custom doctolib dialog
	- React router v6 doesn't allow route transition prevention or natively listening to route change events:

	- potential solution using history package:
